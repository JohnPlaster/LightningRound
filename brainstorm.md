## today was a win
hi
so im running out of brainpower for this sitting but im counting it as a win
- I set up github & learned how that works
- I found a cool way to hang my phone on my computer to watch youtube tutorials without taking up screen space
- I learned that github copilot takes a paid subscription and i don't think i want to jump thru that hoop just yet

## to do
- [ ] figure out why my new earbuds don't like zorin
- [ ] contemplate resetting everything again & switching back to ubuntu (already have the flash stick)
- [ ] make a nested outline of this project
